<strong> Meter installation is a very simple process when the person executing the it is properly trained and authorized. Digital meters can last for about 15 to 20 years when they are properly installed, controlled and maintained by qualified technicians. In the installation of these meters, proper care should be taken to insure that the respective components chosen are meant for measurements. Selecting a protective voltage or current transformer for a metering system is relatively a bad idea as non of this transformer easily saturate during voltage or current perturbations, which could generate failures and false readings in meters. SL7000 energy meter installations can be done in two different ways:
1. The indirect connection without Voltage transformers method and,
2. The indirect connection with voltage transformers method.
These methods are explained in this article.</strong>
